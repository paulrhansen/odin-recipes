        <h2>Big game cheesy chip dip</h2>
        <p>This dip recipe for my big football game parties every year, and everyone raves over it. You can make it as spicy or as mild as you want.</p>

        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (2 pound) loaf processed cheese (such as Velveeta®), cubed</li>
            <li>1 pound bulk spicy pork sausage/li>
            <li>1 (24 ounce) jar hot salsa</li>
            <li>½ cup hot pepper sauce (such as Frank's RedHot®)</li>
            <li>3 large jalapeno peppers, chopped (Optional)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>Directions</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Melt processed cheese in a slow cooker on Low.</li>
            <li>Cook and stir pork sausage in a large skillet over medium heat until browned and crumbly, about 10 minutes; drain excess grease.</li>
            <li>Mix sausage into processed cheese in the slow cooker. Stir in salsa, hot sauce, and jalapeño peppers.</li>
            <li>Cook on Low for 2 hours; serve hot.</li>
        </ol>
    </div>

    <div>
        <h3>Cook's Note:</h3>
        <p>If you want a milder dip, use mild sausage and salsa and cut hot sauce down to 1/4 cup. I wouldn't eliminate the hot sauce because it really adds to the flavor.</p>
